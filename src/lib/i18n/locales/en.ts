		`Meaningle is based on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://semantle.com/">Semantle</a>
    which was created by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://games.novalis.org/">David Turner</a>.`,

		`The idea of the game is to guess the daily secret word using word meanings as hints.
    The game assigns similarity points to each of your guesses, ranging from -100 to 100.
    The closer the points are to 100, the closer you are to the secret word. In this game,
    similarity means that words appear in similar contexts. For example, "<b>dog</b>" and
    "<b>bark</b>" are very similar, so the written form doesn't necessarily have anything
    to do with semantic similarity.`,

		`Secret words are in their uninflected form, start with a lowercase letter, and are single words.
    Secret words can be nouns, adjectives, or verbs, but you can input words from any word class
    in your guesses. When your guess is among the thousand closest words, the bar in the
    <b>'Getting warm?'</b> column of the table shows exactly how close the guess is.`,

		`The task is difficult and you'll probably need dozens of attempts to find the secret word. If you get stuck,
    you can also use the hint button found below the table. You can use up to 15 hints during one game.
    <u>The secret word changes every day at 12:00 AM (UTC+3)</u>.`,
	],
	faq: {
		howCalculated: {
			title: 'How is similarity calculated?',
			content: `The game uses word vectors to measure how similar words are to each other.
			  These vectors convert word meanings into numbers that computers can understand. The vectors were created using
				the GloVe algorithm and raw text data. You can find more information about GloVe
				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GloVe">here</a>. The
				similarity between two words is calculated by computing the cosine similarity between
				their word vectors (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a>).`,
		},
		whatData: {
			title: 'What data is used for the word vectors?',
			content: `Meaningle uses pre-trained GloVe word vectors from the 
				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">Stanford's GloVe project</a> 
				(specifically the <code>glove.6B.300d.txt</code> dataset). The vectors are 300-dimensional. 
				Before storing the vectors in the database, they were lemmatized (converted to their uninflected form) 
				as a preprocessing step. This is why words like "slept" won't be found as they're not in their base form. 
				The game only recognizes words from a curated list of common English words.`,
		},
		yesterdayWord: {
			title: "What was yesterday's word?",
			content: `Yesterday's word was "<YESTERDAY_WORD>". The closest words to it were <YESTERDAY_NEARBY_10>.`,
		},
		wordSelection: {
			title: 'How are secret words selected?',
			content: `I took the 5000 most common words from the training data, shuffled them, and removed words from 
				incorrect word classes. Some questionable words have also been filtered out. From the remaining words,
				I randomly picked around 700 to be used as secret words.`,
		},
		sortGuesses: {
			title: 'Can I sort my guesses differently?',
			content: `Yes. By clicking the "#" at the top of the first column, you'll get the guesses in the order you entered them. 
				Clicking it again reverses the order. Clicking "Guess" sorts them alphabetically. When entering a new guess, 
				they're sorted by similarity again for clarity.`,
		},
		multipleGames: {
			title: 'Can I play more than one game per day or play old games?',
			content: `No. The one-game-per-day limit makes playing more communal as everyone is solving the same word. 
				This also prevents players from getting tired of the game and makes them invest more in their single daily attempt.`,
		},
		otherLanguages: {
			title: 'Can I play in other languages?',
